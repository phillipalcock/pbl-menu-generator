## Additional Notes

This class is preparing for GCSE assessments. The projects should stretch students to think at analysis and evaluation level (not just description). Several students are strong writers; others are more visual learners — please ensure the brief options allow for both written and non-written modes of expression. Students will present final projects to an external panel in Week 10.
